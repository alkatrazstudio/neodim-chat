Neodim Chat allows you to chat with AI-powered bot via Neodim Server (https://github.com/alkatrazstudio/neodim-server).

NOTE: Before installing this app, make sure that you're able to run Neodim Server and you understand how it works!

Neodim Chat will allow you to do the following:

* Create a chat between two participants.

* A reply of any participant can be written by you or AI. E.g. AI can talk with itself or you can write messages for it, or vice versa.

* Setup any model parameters and other parameters that Neodim Server supports, e. g. "temperature", "top-p", "tail-free sampling" etc. Read more about these parameters on the Neodim Server's page (https://github.com/alkatrazstudio/neodim-server#api-request). The app also has a built-in help page.

* Set preamble (https://github.com/alkatrazstudio/neodim-server#prompt-and-preamble).

* Auto-correction of common misspellings.

* Change text in any message by tapping it.

* Undo, redo and retry buttons.

* Color customization for speech bubbles.

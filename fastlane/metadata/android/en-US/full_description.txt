Neodim Chat allows you to chat with AI-powered bot via Neodim Server (https://github.com/alkatrazstudio/neodim-server) or llama.cpp (https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp).

NOTE: Before installing this app, make sure that you're able to run Neodim Server or llama.cpp and you understand how these servers work.


== KEY FEATURES ==

* Chat between two or more participants
* The next chat participant can be chosen by AI
* Write a story (as a "monologue" of one participant)
* Text adventure game simulation
* Write comments in between chat lines (i.e. non-dialog text)
* Quick controls to generate/edit messages for any chat participant and undo/redo/retry messages
* Continue the last message with generated text
* Retry only the newly generated part of a message
* Continuous generation (AI chats with itself or generates a story until manually stopped)
* Advanced repetition penalty settings
* Force the use of new words when retrying to generate the message, i.e. no same message on retry
* Generate several messages upfront for quick retries (no loss of speed, but requires more VRAM, also only available when using Neodim Server)
* Auto-correcting some English grammar and punctuation, e.g. `i dont know, mr anderson` => `I don't know, Mr. Anderson.`
* View/copy the chat/story content as plain text
* Undo the text by sentence
* Color customization for speech bubbles
* Built-in help

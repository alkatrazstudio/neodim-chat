Neodim Chat allows you to chat with AI-powered bot via Neodim Server (https://github.com/alkatrazstudio/neodim-server).

NOTE: Before installing this app, make sure that you're able to run Neodim Server and you understand how it works. Neodim Chat does not work without Neodim Server!


== KEY FEATURES ==

* Chat between two or more participants
* The next chat participant is chosen by AI (when more than participants are involved)
* Write a story (as a "monologue" of one participant)
* Text adventure game simulation
* Quick controls to generate/edit messages for any chat participant and undo/redo/retry messages
* Only the required amount of tokens are requested, i.e. not wasting GPU time on what is not needed
* Continuous generation (AI chats with itself or generates a story until manually stopped)
* Advanced repetition penalty settings
* Force the use of new words when retrying message generation, i.e. no same message on retry
* Generate several messages upfront for quick retries (no loss of speed, but requires more VRAM)
* Auto-correcting some English grammar and punctuation, e.g. "i don't know, mr anderson" => "I don't know, Mr. Anderson."
* View/copy the chat/story content as plain text
* Undo the text by sentence
* Color customization for speech bubbles.
* Built-in help

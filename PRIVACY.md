# Neodim Chat - PRIVACY POLICY

Neodim Chat allows you to communicate with automated AI (a robot).
There's no interaction between humans in this application.

Neodim Chat does not knowingly collect, send, share or store
any personally identifiable information (PII).
However, the information needed to generate an AI response
will be send to the Neodim Server by URL specified in the settings.
This will include parts of current chat conversation
and some technical data required to fulfill the current request
(does not contain PII).

Neodim Chat does not use any third-party Internet services by default. 
But it requires a connection to Neodim Server instance, which is provided by the user.

Neodim Chat contains links to other websites.
When a user clicks any link it will open a web browser
which is not controlled by Neodim Chat and may have its own Privacy Policy.

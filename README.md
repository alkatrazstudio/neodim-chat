# Neodim Chat

A mobile application that allows you to chat with AI via
[Neodim Server](https://github.com/alkatrazstudio/neodim-server).

**NOTE:** Before installing this application make sure that you can run
[Neodim Server](https://github.com/alkatrazstudio/neodim-server)
and that you understand how it works.
Neodim Chat fully relies on Nedim Server and does not work without it.


## Chat mode

The main purpose of Neodim Chat is to allow you to have a conversation
with a chat bot that is powered by a GPT-compatible language model.
Read more about supported models
[here](https://github.com/alkatrazstudio/neodim-server#supported-models).

The application will allow you to do the following:

* Create a chat between two "persons".

* A reply of any participant can be written by you or AI.
  E.g. AI can talk with itself or you can write messages for it, or vice versa.

* Setup any model parameters and other parameters
  that Neodim Server supports,
  e. g. "temperature", "top-p", "tail-free sampling" etc.
  Read more about these parameters
  [here](https://github.com/alkatrazstudio/neodim-server#api-request)
  and inside the application's built-in help page.

* Set [preamble](https://github.com/alkatrazstudio/neodim-server#prompt-and-preamble).

* Auto-correction of common misspellings.

* Change text in any message by tapping it.

* Undo, redo and retry buttons.

* Color customization for speech bubbles.

**An example of the chat mode**

All blue messages were generated by AI.


## Adventure mode

Adventure mode lets you play a text adventure game.
In this mode the first chat participant is the player,
and the other one is the "story" (or a game master).

AI can't generate the player actions,
but you can write the story.

It's preferable to prefix all player's actions with "You",
e.g. "You pat the goblin." instead of just "Pat the goblin."

**NOTE:** Neodim Chat is not adequately designed for this mode,
so you may experience some bugs and other weird behavior.

All blue messages except the first one were generated by AI.



## Build

Neodim Chat is made with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev).

To build this application do the following:

1. Download this repository.

2. Install Flutter and Android SDK. It's easier to do it from [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

3. At this point you can already debug the application from Android Studio.
   To build the release version follow the next steps.

4. Go inside the repository root and create the file
   `android/key.properties` based on [android/key.template.properties](android/key.template.properties).
   Fill in all fields.
   For more information see the official "[Signing the app](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android#signing-the-app)" tutorial.

5. To build the release APK run `./build.sh apk` inside the repository root.
   To build the release Android App Bundle run `./build.sh bundle`.
   These scripts will remove the entire `build` directory before building,
   so e.g. `./build.sh bundle` will remove the APK file that was built by `./build.sh apk`.
